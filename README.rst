Morepath Wiki
=============

Introduction
------------

This is a simple wiki implementation. It's based on the `"Web micro-framework
battle"`_, a 2011 presentation by Richard Jones. In it he implements a simple
wiki in a number of Python web micro-frameworks to compare them.

In 2013, Martijn Fraassen figured it would be interesting to see how Morepath
stacks up, and also to try building a more real application with Morepath to
work out the kinks in Morepath itself.

Richard kindly made available the codebase_ for that presentation, which was
used to create an implementation using Morepath. Apart from a few
inconsequential changes, ``storage.py`` is completely taken from Richard's
codebase as the underlying model code for the Morepath wiki.

The `Html library`_, also by Richard, had to be bundled due to installation
problems under Python 3.

Getting started
---------------

To get started with Morepath_wiki right away, you can install it and run it in
a newly created `virtual environment`_::

  $ virtualenv env
  $ ./env/bin/pip install morepath_wiki
  $ ./env/bin/morepath_wiki

You can now access the wiki at http://localhost:5000.


Installation from sources
-------------------------

You can grab the sources from GitHub_ and set them up in a fresh `virtual environment`_::

  $ git clone https://github.com/morepath/morepath_wiki.git
  $ cd morepath_wiki
  $ virtualenv env
  $ ./env/bin/pip install -e '.[test]'

You'll then be able to start the wiki::

  $ ./env/bin/morepath_wiki

And to run the test suite::

  $ ./env/bin/py.test -v
